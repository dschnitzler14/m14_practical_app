Welcome to this Data Analysis and R Tutorial.

**There are many, many tutorials to learn data analysis and R, ranging from beginner to advanced, so why make a new one?**

Well, we think that one of the best ways to learn something is to do something. So, we have created this app for you, that guides you through the bascis of R using your own data and allows you to explore what it it can do. This app creates a 'mock R' environment that works just like the real R, but it a little less overwhelming.
